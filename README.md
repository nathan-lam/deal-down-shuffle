# deal-down-shuffle
This repository explores the property of the deal down shuffle.

The deal down shuffle is a "shuffle" but it is more like a mathematical shuffle used by magicians to reveal a card.

Starting with a small pack of cards (face down) do these steps:
1. Deal the top into a separate pile
2. Deal the next to the bottom of the pack youre dealing from.
3. Repeat 1 and 2 until all the cards go into the separate pile

This page goes more in depth about the shuffle.

Magicians will use this shuffle by positioning a card such that it will end up as the last card dealt when doing the shuffle. Though this use, knowing which position goes to the first position is usually the desired effect. 
My exploration finds an (approximate) formula to find the ending position is given the numbers of cards in the packet and the starting position.
